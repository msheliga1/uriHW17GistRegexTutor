# Mike Sheliga's Regular Expression Tutorial

Searching for text within a line, paragraph or document is a common and important task. Most people are use to searching for exact text such as "cat", but if you wish to search for complex matches, such as any email address or any phone number, regular expressions are a powerful tool.  

## Summary 
  
In this tutorial we look at regular expressions, which are a tool for simple to very complex searches, including:  
  
(1) What regular expressions are and why they are used for complex searches.  
(2) Simple examples of regular expressions.  
(3) Common portions of regular expressions that equate to functionality such as "or", "start of string" and "numbers". 
(4) Searching using regular expressions and the example of searching for hexadecimal numbers, which has a regular expression 
of /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/.
